# 15OS (My Personal Site!)

**Live site:** [noahscratch493.github.io](https://noahscratch493.github.io)

This site is a **fully interactive Windows 10–style personal desktop**, but everything is about me, Noah. It’s a playful mix of nostalgia, humor, and creativity, designed to feel like a miniature Windows 10 computer running in your browser.

  * **Chromify**
  * **Scratch 2 Beta**

### **Paint App**

* Fully functional drawing app with:

  * **Pencil**, **Eraser**, **Line**, **Rectangle**, **Circle**
  * Preset colors + **custom color picker**

### **Windows 10 Mobile Layout**

* Simulates **Windows 10 Mobile** for smaller screens.

* Works interactively like a mobile OS, though some apps are desktop-only.

### **Humor & Easter Eggs**

* Foam icon made from **Show Me Whiteboard Rubbers** — silly and fun!
* Clippy acts as Notepad using TinyMCE.
* Multiple Scratch versions on the desktop, including a hacked Scratch 2 Beta.
* Nostalgic nods to old Windows and early web tools.
